# Why Java?

Because I was being tested in Java by the Bol company.

# Why not Spring?

It's a simple project that doesn't need to be build upon a huge framework. Frameworks are a big chunk of pre-built code which you add to your own code to solve problems. A few years ago (~1999), when programing in Java for the web was complex, we needed frameworks to make our apps cleaner, faster and easy to maintain.

Examples of frameworks:

* JSF (v. 1.0 - 2004): A Java specification for building _component-based UI for webapps_. [Some people criticise JSF](https://dzone.com/articles/why-you-should-avoid-jsf) due to the fact that the interface (HTML) is intrincictly connected to the back-end (Bean), and, therefore, the front-end attributes can change the server side life cycle, violating the [separation of concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns). Some people defend the framework saying that it is already updated to be statefull (version 2.0+) and to scale well.

* Spring (v. 1.0 - 2003): An application framework that helps you to _connect and combine different components together_. It makes heavy use of annotations to minimize the amount of configuration in XML files. But this can make the code [harder to debug and maintain](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-criticisms-of-the-Spring-Framework), pointed out by some programmers that this framework is pure [magic](http://samatkinson.com/why-i-hate-spring/) (BTW, the author doesn't like magic and neither do I). Overall, Spring work well with mocking libs due to the dependency injection concept, so testing is relatively simple.

# Statefull vs Stateless

A StateFULL protocol is a communication protocol in which the session information is maintained either on the server or on the client; example: JSF. StateLESS is the opposite (no session); example: IP.
